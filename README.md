### // YOU ARE THE MEDICINE

![FUNGAL AVATARS vol. I](https://github.com/elschilling/fungal-avatars/blob/master/public/assets/healers.png)

Long before computers, the internet, cellphones, VR glasses or other expensive electronic devices, our ancestors had other ways of getting connected.
Sacred mushrooms or as Terence McKenna called it, the food of gods were eaten to sharpen senses, experience the miracle of existence with other lenses and healing power.

Here you find mycellium avatars imagined and generated through today interplanetary internet, each hash leading to a different hue variation and with one fungi verse inspired from Maria Sabina curandera poetry.

There is a small chance to find a stone fungi sculpture or a bee-faced mushroom, echoes from cave paintings made long time ago and still present in humanity's collective memory.
